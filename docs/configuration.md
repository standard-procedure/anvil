# Anvil configuration files

An Anvil configuration file specifies the configuration for multiple servers and multiple apps.  Each server is configured, then each app is installed onto each server.

For now take a look at the two samples in the spec folder - [single-server](/spec/fixtures/single-server.config.yml) and [multi-server](/spec/fixtures/multi-server.config.yml).
